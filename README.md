# Cliff Essentials

<!-- ![App hero image](./client/public/assets/img/readme/app.png) -->

## Description

I started working at a hotel who has an after hours sundries shop for late night snacks. Fairly standard practice but a paper and pen system is used to list the customer's order then use a calculator to add up their entire order üò≤! My boss told me they had an old employee make a web app but he quit and the prices became outdated. I found the build file and reverse engineered their original app. I was able to learn a lot from their code but I have become an anti-Bootstrap snob üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è so I started my app from scratch using Tailwind and TypeScript

### Client

This app is rendered using React. My main goal was to make it much easier to take a customer's order and give them a total. I then wanted to simplify the process to charge the appropriate account.

### Bugs

I used the newer crypto JS API for giving mapped JSX content a unique key, but some machines at work have updates blocked by IT for the browser. So some computers are able to use it and some are not. I just fell back on the classic UUID NPM Package

### Future Development

The core issue with the previous developer's app was that new staff could not update the prices. This is very easily fixed with a simple database integration. My boss said they may finally get a Square setup for the shop so I'm holding off development of this feature for now
